# [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat).

To get started, checkout [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)!



## Quick start

Three quick start options are available:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git`.
* Install with Twitter's [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower): `bower install bootstrap`.

Read the [Getting Started page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) for information on the framework contents, basic template guidelines, and more.



## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/).

## Documentation

Bootstrap's docs are built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages at [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com). To view our docs locally, you'll need to [install Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) to run a local server.

Documentation for [previous versions](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tags) is also available via tags.



## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

Bootstrap includes a makefile with convenient methods for working with the framework. Before getting started, be sure to install the necessary local dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Once installed, you'll be able to run the various make commands provided:

#### build - `make`
Runs the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs. Requires recess and uglify-js.

#### test - `make test`
Runs jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.

#### watch - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.



## Contributing

Please submit all pull requests against *-wip branches. If your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you must include relevant unit tests. All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo).
